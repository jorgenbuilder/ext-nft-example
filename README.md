# Hands-on with EXT NFT

An NFT tarot card deck implementation using [Toniq Labs' EXT token standard](https://github.com/Toniq-Labs/extendable-token/). Be aware, to make this a more useable demonstration, we omit the access control you'd want in a real implementation.

1. Run `mintNFT`: Punch in any old principal to mint an NFT under that principal's ownership.
2. Run `readLedger`: There's your NFT!
3. Run `transfer`: 

Now you have the primitive capabilities of an NFT under your superhero belt 🐱‍🏍!
